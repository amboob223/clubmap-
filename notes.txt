As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there isn't a specific library for Mapbox in React Native like the Mapbox GL library for web applications. However, you can use the react-native-maps library, which provides a MapView component that you can use with Mapbox by setting the Mapbox style URL.

Here's a step-by-step guide to integrating Mapbox in a React Native application using react-native-maps:

Install the Required Packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install react-native-maps
Link the Package (for React Native versions less than 0.60):

For React Native versions less than 0.60, you need to link the package:

bash
Copy code
react-native link react-native-maps
Get Mapbox Access Token:

Sign up for a Mapbox account and obtain an access token from the Mapbox Dashboard.

Update AndroidManifest.xml:

Add your Mapbox access token to the AndroidManifest.xml file. Replace YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN with your actual token.

xml
Copy code
<application>
  <!-- ... other configurations ... -->
  <meta-data
    android:name="com.mapbox.token"
    android:value="YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN" />
</application>
Create a React Native Component:

javascript
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import MapView, { PROVIDER_GOOGLE } from 'react-native-maps';

const YourMapComponent = () => {
  return (
    <MapView
      style={{ flex: 1 }}
      provider={PROVIDER_GOOGLE}
      showsUserLocation={true}
      initialRegion={{
        latitude: 37.7749,
        longitude: -122.4194,
        latitudeDelta: 0.0922,
        longitudeDelta: 0.0421,
      }}
      // Set the Mapbox style URL
      customMapStyle={[]}
    />
  );
};

export default YourMapComponent;
Replace the YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN placeholder with your actual Mapbox access token. You can customize the initialRegion and other properties according to your requirements.

The customMapStyle prop is where you can provide a custom Mapbox style URL if needed. For example:

javascript
Copy code
customMapStyle={[
  {
    "elementType": "labels.icon",
    "stylers": [
      {
        "visibility": "off"
      }
    ]
  }
]}
